# Readme
This project is taking the original **Kelsey Hightower** [github](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
to who should be directed all the credits. There are small differences, to permit to run it in local with VirtualBox,
and reusable with Ansible. My setup is a Mac and this is a pretty common. 
The goal is to have a working cluster locally, even with a balancer for the controllers, for testing purposes. 

## Requirements
- Python3, pip and virtualenv installed, for virtualenv use pip:
  - `pip install virtualenv`
- At least 8 GB of ram, there will be created 5 VMs (nodes 2GB each one, controllers and loadbalancer 1GB), in `Vagrantfile`
- `Virtualbox` as the hypervisor for `Vagrant`: [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- `Vagrant` will be the wrapper to interact with `Virtualbox` to provide the VMs: [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  
## Configure the Vagrantfile
In the directory `vagrant` there is a file called `Vagrantfile` which is configured to create 5 VMs, composed as following: 
- 2 nodes (workers)
- 2 masters (controllers)
- 1 load balancer

In the `Vagrantfile` there are also the information about IP addresses, memory an CPU for VMs. Changing IP addresses means 
you have to change them also here: `playbooks/inventory/group_vars/all.yml`. It is possible to change the number of workers nodes
with the variable `number_node` and the number of controllers `number_master`. It is also possible to add new nodes, 
in this case there is also the need to add them in the `workers_list` and provide the correct number in `number_node`. 

### Steps to rollout and provisioning
1. Create and run the python venv: `virtualenv env && source env/bin/activate`
2. Install pip requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `cd vagrant` and run `vagrant up`, wait for the VMs are up and running
4. Back to the root of the project and run ansible to generate hostfile: `ansible-playbook playbooks/k8s.yml --diff -t hosts`
5. Run ansible again to provision the cluster: `ansible-playbook playbooks/k8s.yml --diff -K` 

- Pause the environment: `cd vagrant` and run `vagrant halt`
- Clean up: 
    - `cd vagrant` and run `vagrant destroy -f`
    - remove all the files in `k8s-certs`

### TODO
1. Make it compatible for linux, currently all the binaries are hardcoded for mac
2. Improve the abstraction, currently many things are hardcoded
3. Add compatibility with newer version of ubuntu (or debian based)
4. Make the network plugin configurable
6. Add monitoring: prometheus and grafana
7. Add logs: grafana/loki
